- 👋 Hi, I’m @LeakFinder
- 👀 I’m interested in learning! The industry I've spent the last 15 years in is severely lacking software solutions. I have been studying the last 6 months trying to understand large language models and I'm excited to finally start putting some of this knowledge to use.
- About a year and a half ago I didn't even know how to use Excel in the most basic way while working a full time job and having a little girl to take care of along with my wife I've spent every waking moment outside of hanging out with them and working dedicated to trying to learn this. I have not watched a single bit of television in over two years.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Had to do everything, I have only written one tiny little web scraper as of 4/27/24. By the way,I didn't do it, Chat Gpt did....hahajaa
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on, I don't know...
- 📫 How to reach me, smoke signals work best!
- 😄 Pronouns: Meat Popcycle 
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... Apparently the newest Image creation model can create over 1000 cats with hats per second. This new unit of measure needs to be indoctrinated worldwide.
